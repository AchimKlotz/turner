# What is Turner?

Turner is a responsive and easy-to-use 3D item viewer for the modern Web, along with an intuitive configuration backend. It allows to seamlessly publish 3D models embedded into common Web pages, without any plugins, and it runs on all common Web-capable devices (including smart phones and tablets). Through the extensible configuration backend, 3D model owners can setup the exact user experience and 3D tools they desire for their end users.

Primary use cases include:

* 3D product visualization for advertisement and online shopping

* Visualization of digitized cultural heritage for virtual museums

* Visualization of items for scientific purposes (e.g., medicine, natural history)


# Technical Scope

Setting the technical scope more precisely, Turner is ...

* an optimized framework for the creation of fast and intuitively usable 3D online presentations of many single items, using an easy-to-use editor for customizable templates.

* focusing on intuitive interaction and responsive behavior for optimal presentation on all devices, preventing users from getting "lost in (3D) space".

* compatible with CDNs (see [examples](...)) for worldwide asset delivery at maximum speed.


Turner is *not* ...

* a 3D rendering framework itself (but supports the use of different underlying 3D renderers).

* a viewing tool for AR or VR use cases.

* an "out-of-core" viewing tool for massive 3D models.


# Which formats are supported?

Currently, the only accepted input format for turner is *glTF* (.glTF and .glb).
We believe in open, royalty-free standards, and glTF - the "jpeg for 3D" - fits very well with the mission of Turner: becoming a broadly used, open-source item viewer for the modern Web.


# What is the team behind Turner?

Turner is an open-source project, driven by the world-wide 3D community.
